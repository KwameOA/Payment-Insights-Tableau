# Payment-Insights-Tableau

I analysed a business’s transaction data using Tableau, uncovering key trends and areas for improvement in their payment processes. Here’s what stood out:

• Total Annual Payments: A line graph highlighted yearly trends, showing fluctuations in total payments received. 

• Top 10 Customers: This revealed the highest-paying customers, but an interesting anomaly stood out-the top spot was occupied by a ghost name (unknown customer), raising questions about data integrity and missing or misclassified customer data.

• Transactions Without Customers & Blank Amounts: The analysis also flagged payments with no associated customers and transactions with null or blank amounts. These gasps could indicate data entry errors, system issues, or even potential fraud risks. 

• Payment System Trends:
A clustered column chart showed the frequency of different payment systems used over the three years.

Another clustered column chart visualized the total amount generated by each payment system, helping assess their impact on revenue.

Key Insights:

- Data inconsistencies (ghost names, missing customers, and blank amounts) need addressing to improve reporting accuracy.
- Reviewing the most-used and highest-revenue payment systems can help optimize business strategies.
- Clean, well-structured payment data leads to better financial decisions and improved customer insights.

Note: The amounts in this analysis are in Ghana Cedis (GHS) but were omitted from the visuals to maintain a clean and readable dashboard.
